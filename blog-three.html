            <h2>Web Framework</h2>

        <h3>What is a Web Framework?</h2>
            <p>A <strong>web framework (WF)</strong> or <strong>web application framework (WAF)</strong> is a software
                framework that is
                designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web
                APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web.
                Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web
                development. For example, many web frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating
                frameworks, and session management, and they often promote code reuse.Although they often target
                development of dynamic web sites, they are also applicable to static websites.
            </p>
            <h3>Model–view–controller (MVC)</h3>
            <p>Many frameworks follow the MVC <strong>architectural pattern</strong> to separate the data model into
                business rules (the
                "controller") and the user interface (the "view"). This is generally considered a good practice as it
                modularizes code, promotes code reuse, and allows multiple interfaces to be applied. In web
                applications, this permits different views to be presented, for example serving different web pages for
                mobile vs. desktop browsers, or providing machine-readable web service interfaces.</p>
            <h3>Push-based vs. pull-based</h3>
            <p>Most <strong>MVC frameworks</strong> follow a push-based architecture also called "action-based". These frameworks use
                actions that do the required processing, and then "push" the data to the view layer to render the
                results.[5] An alternative to this is pull-based architecture, sometimes also called "component-based".
                These frameworks start with the view layer, which can then "pull" results from multiple controllers as
                needed. In this architecture, multiple controllers can be involved with a single view.</p>
